Cry-MADE IN HEIGHTS
Made In Heights - Cry
I love the way you talk
The way you're askin' me please, over and over
It’s getting hard to stop the shakin' in my knees, over and over
I love the lines we draw, amber and indigo
Oh my baby love, you make the heavens show
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
This ain’t no silly
I'm not wrecking my metaphors whole
I'll take it by the horns then ride like I'm queen of it all
When I’m righteous or ready
When I’m callous or crazy
When I'm crowning the top of the world
When my power is frightening and my destiny's shining
Know that I’m always your girl
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
You don’t know me at all
You know you make
You make me cry from deep down inside
You make the stars fall down
Fall from the sky like the 4th of July
You make my tears come down
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
You make me cry, cry, cry, cry
