Generation Blue-Niia
Have you ever felt so knowing
Where you know your truth
Nothing but a great big nothing
Hanging high just like a noose
oh I miss the days when I used to cry
oh Being alone was harder than goodbye
Survive
We keep running like we're born wild
And I won't stop until there's someone
someone all mine
All of this expensive sadness
I'm a junkie for it too
Wearing the same lonely color
We're generation blue
oh I miss the days when I used to cry
oh Being alone was harder than goodbye
Survive
We keep running cause we're born wild
And I won't stop until there's someone,all mine
Someone,all mine
We're all blue
We're all blue(Yeah,we're all blue)
Survive
We keep running cause we're born wild
And I won't stop until there's someone,all mine
Someone that's all mine
