22 - Taylor Swift
作曲 : Taylor Swift/Max Martin/Shellback
 作词 : Taylor Swift/Max Martin/Shellback
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah-ah ah-ah
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused
And lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah
Tonight's the night when
We forget about the deadlines
It's time
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing
Like we're 22
Twenty-two
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Ah-ah ah-ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused
And lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh yeah
Tonight's the night when
We forget about the heartbreaks
It's time
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
Alright
We just keep dancing
Like we're 22
Twenty-two
I don't know about you
Twenty-two
Twenty-two
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah hey
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing
Dance like we're
Like we're 22
Twenty-two
Twenty-two
Twenty-two
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
