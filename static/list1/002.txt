1 Night
You are something special, mm
Twenty carats of lit gold
What we had was precious, mm
But I had to let you go
We have a connection
But another type of girl who wants
Serious affection
Doesn't belong in my world
It was only was only night but I
Wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
It was only was only night but I
Wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go
It was only one night
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go back to where we were
It was only was only night but I
Wanna go
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go back to where we were
It was only was only night but I
Wanna go
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go back to where we were
Got that chain reaction, ooh
Didn't know what it was worth
Sixteen million mentions, ooh
Ain't picking up the whole damn earth, na na na
We have a connection
But another type of girl who you
You are an exception, oh yeah
Yeah you blew my mind I wanna rewind
It was only one night but I
Wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
It was only was only night but I
Wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go back to where we were
I just wanna go
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go
It was only one night
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go back to where we were
It was only was only night but I
Wanna go
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go back to where we were
It was only was only night but I
Wanna go
Do you wanna go
Do you wanna go back to where we were
It was only was only night
