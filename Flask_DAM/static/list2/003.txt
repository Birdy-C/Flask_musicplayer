Always Be-TVÃ…
You don't need say a word
Everything you send the open
You don't need to act such child
We feel apart when we're broken
Baby, if you want me in you life
I will always be
If you want me in your arms
I will always be
I will always be
I will always be
You don't need to feel your fear
I can see you hide it from me
Don't you know I'm still right here
I'm just one, I'm the only
Baby, if you want me in your life
I will always be
If you want me in your arms
I will always be
I will always be, be, be...
Tonight I'll live my life
Just like we were never meant to be
And we will be alright
I never will forget you
And all we said and done
We can see clearly
I'm not the one
But even though we've been put to rest
There's nothing to love
Baby, if you want me in your life
I will always be
If you want me in your arms
I will always be
Baby, if you want me in your life
I will always be
There's nothing
There's nothing
Baby, if you want me in your life
I'll always be
There's nothing
There's nothing to love
There's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing to love
Baby, if you want me in your life
I'll always be
There's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing to love
Baby, if you want me in your life
I'll always be
I'll always be
I'll always be
I'll always be
