Hold Me-Janine and the Mixtape
Baby don't let me down
Got a lot goin on right now
And I need you to hold me (need you to hold me)
Baby don't let me down
Got a lot goin on right now
And I need you beside me (need you beside me)
And when it gets cold
And I'm feelin kinda lonely
I'm hopin that you're gonna put a cover on me
When it gets cold
And I'm feelin kinda lonely
I'm hopin that you're gonna put a cover on meeee (oooooo
Baby if I break down
Will you catch my tears before they hit the ground (the grooouunnd)
Oh baby if I open my mouth
And let my darkest memories come ooouut
I need you to stick around (need you to stick aroound)
And when it gets cold
And I'm feelin kinda lonely
I'm hopin that you're gonna put cover on me
When it gets cold
And I'm feeling kinda lonely
I'm hopin that you're gonna put a cover on meeee


Oh give me something good to feel
Touch me so I know it's real
Make it so I won't forget
And take me far from my regret
Oh give me something good to feel
Touch me so I know it's real
Never want to ask for help
But I'm asking this time
Baby don't let me down
Got a lot goin on right now
And I need you to hold me
Oh, baby don't let me down
I got a lot goin on right now
And I need you beside meeeee
